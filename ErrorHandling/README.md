## JAVASCRIPT ERRORS

# Errors
    Errors can be coding errors made by the programmer, 
    errors due to wrong input, and 
    other unforeseeable things.

## Throw, and Try...Catch...Finally

# Try: 
    The try statement defines a code block to run (to try).
# Catch: 
    The catch statement defines a code block to handle any error.
# Throw: 
    The throw statement defines a custom error.
    
# Finally: 
    This statement defines a code block to run regardless of the result.

# The Error Object:
    JavaScript will create an Error object with two properties: 
    name and message.
    Error Name Values
# Six different values can be returned by the error name property:

# Error Name	    Description
  EvalError	        An error has occurred in the eval() function
  RangeError	    A number "out of range" has occurred
  ReferenceError    An illegal reference has occurred
  SyntaxError	    A syntax error has occurred
  TypeError	        A type error has occurred
  URIError	        An error in encodeURI() has occurred
